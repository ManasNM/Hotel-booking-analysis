#Hotel Booking Data Analysis

Description:
In this project, we analyzed the Hotel Booking dataset to understand booking patterns, customer preferences, and potential business opportunities. The dataset includes information on hotel types, booking lead times, cancellation rates, and customer demographics, among others. Our objective was to find insights that can improve customer satisfaction and optimize booking strategies.

Algorithms/Techniques Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used to analyze trends such as lead time, cancellation rates, and guest demographics.
Data Visualization: Techniques like bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps were employed to highlight key trends.
Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistics were computed to provide an overall picture of the dataset.
Correlation Analysis: Examined relationships between different variables to find significant factors affecting bookings.

Conclusion:
The analysis revealed several key insights:

Cancellations were significantly influenced by longer lead times.
Family-oriented hotels saw more cancellations compared to business hotels.
Early bookings tended to have a higher chance of modification or cancellation. These insights provide valuable information to hotels in formulating cancellation policies, promotional offers, and operational strategies to better manage booking rates and improve customer satisfaction.
